# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions.
name: Android CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks out your repository and its submodules
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: 'recursive' # <-- This is the required fix

      # 2. Sets up the Java Development Kit (JDK) for Gradle
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: gradle

      # 3. Grants execute permission to the gradlew script
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew
        working-directory: ./android

      # 4. Builds the project using the Gradle wrapper
